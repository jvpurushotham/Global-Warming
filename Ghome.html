    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>G</span>lobal warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming has presented another issue called climate change. Sometimes these phrases are used interchangeably, however, they are different. Climate change refers to changes in weather patterns and growing seasons around the world. It also refers to sea level rise caused by the expansion of warmer seas and melting ice sheets and glaciers. Global warming causes climate change, which poses a serious threat to life on Earth in the forms of widespread flooding and extreme weather. Scientists continue to study global warming and its impact on Earth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature near the earth’s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial but the scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that the temperature of the earth is rising constantly.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several causes of global warming, which have a negative effect on humans, plants and animals. These causes may be natural or might be the outcome of human activities. In order to curb the issues, it is very important to understand the negative impacts of global warming.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite challenges to control global warming; however, it is not unmanageable. The first step in solving any problem is identifying the cause of the problem. Therefore, we need to first understand the causes of global warming that will help us proceed further in solving it. In this essay on Global Warming, we will see the causes and solutions of Global Warming.</p>

    <br><hr><h2>2.Main causes of Global Warming:</h2><hr>
    <ul>
    <br><h3>There are mainly two types of causes for Global Warming:</h3> 
    <ol>
    <br><li>Man-made Causes of Global Warming</li>
    <li>Natural Causes of Global Warming</li>
    </ol>
    <br><h3>1. Man-made Causes of Global Warming:</h3>
    <ul>
    <br><li>Deforestation</li>
    <li>Use of Vehicles</li>
    <li>Chlorofluorocarbons</li>
    <li>Industrial Development</li>
    <li>Agriculture</li>
    <li>Overpopulation</li></ul>
    <br><h3>Deforestation(Forest clearence):</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deforestation or forest clearance is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests at present.This is one-third less than the forest cover before the expansion of agriculture, with half of that loss occurring in the last century. Between 15 million to 18 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Bangladesh, are destroyed every year. On average 2,400 trees are cut down each minute.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines deforestation as the conversion of forest to other land uses (regardless of whether it is human-induced). "Deforestation" and "forest area net change" are not the same: the latter is the sum of all forest losses (deforestation) and all forest gains (forest expansion) in a given period. Net change, therefore, can be positive or negative, depending on whether gains exceed losses, or vice versa.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resilience of human food systems and their capacity to adapt to future change is linked to biodiversity – including dryland-adapted shrub and tree species that help combat desertification, forest-dwelling insects, bats and bird species that pollinate crops, trees with extensive root systems in mountain ecosystems that prevent soil erosion, and mangrove species that provide resilience against flooding in coastal areas.With climate change exacerbating the risks to food systems, the role of forests in capturing and storing carbon and mitigating climate change is important for the agricultural sector.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FAO estimates that the global forest carbon stock has decreased 0.9%, and tree cover 4.2% between 1990 and 2020.The forest carbon stock in Europe (including Russia) increased from 158.7 to 172.4 Gt between 1990 and 2020. In North America, the forest carbon stock increased from 136.6 to 140 Gt in the same period. However, carbon stock decreased from 94.3 to 80.9 Gt in Africa, 45.8 to 41.5 Gt in South and Southeast Asia combined, 33.4 to 33.1 Gt in Oceania, 5 to 4.1 Gt in Central America, and from 161.8 to 144.8 Gt in South America. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) states that there is disagreement about whether the global forest is shrinking or not, and quote research indicating that tree cover has increased 7.1% between 1982 and 2016. IPCC also writes: "While above-ground biomass carbon stocks are estimated to be declining in the tropics, they are increasing globally due to increasing stocks in temperate and boreal forest.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a 2020 study published in Scientific Reports, if deforestation continues at current rates it can trigger a total or almost total extinction of humanity in the next 20 to 40 years. They conclude that "from a statistical point of view . . . the probability that our civilisation survives itself is less than 10% in the most optimistic scenario." To avoid this collapse, humanity should pass from a civilization dominated by the economy to "cultural society" that "privileges the interest of the ecosystem above the individual interest of its components, but eventually in accordance with the overall communal interest.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degradation of forest ecosystems has also been traced to economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation. Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no economic value that is readily apparent to the forests' owners or the communities that rely on forests for their well-being. From the perspective of the developing world, the benefits of forest as carbon sinks or biodiversity reserves go primarily to richer developed nations and there is insufficient compensation for these services. Developing countries feel that some countries in the developed world, such as the United States of America, cut down their forests centuries ago and benefited economically from this deforestation, and that it is hypocritical to deny developing countries the same opportunities, i.e. that the poor should not have to bear the cost of preservation when the rich created the problem</p>

    <br><h3>Use of vehicles( Air Pollution):</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation is a major source of air pollution and the largest source of global warming emissions in the world.Air pollution is one of the serious environmental concerns of the urban cities where majority of the population is exposed to poor air quality. The rapid urbanization in India has resulted in a tremendous increase in the number of motor vehicles. As the number of vehicles continues to grow and the consequent congestion increases, vehicles are now becoming the main source of air pollution in urban India.The country has taken a number of measures for the improvement of the air quality in cities. These include, the improvement in the fuel quality, formulation of necessary legislation and enforcement of vehicle emission standards, improved traffic planning and management, etc.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automotive vehicles emit several pollutants depending upon the quality of the fuel they consume and engine efficiency. The release of pollutants from vehicles also include fugitive emissions of the fuel and the source and level of these emissions depending upon the vehicle type, its maintenance, etc. The major pollutants released as vehicle/fuel emissions are, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), photochemical oxidants, air toxics, namely benzene (C6H6), aldehydes, 1,3 butadiene (C4H6), lead (Pb), particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of sulphur (SO2) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). While the predominant pollutants in petrol/gasoline driven vehicles are hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, the predominant pollutants from the diesel based vehicles are Oxides of nitrogen and particulates.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the person should turn off the ignition on the red signals. This, in turn, will save fuel and money. At the same time, minor changes in driving like- driving the vehicle on economic speed, apply fewer brakes, reducing quick acceleration can save your fuel and your vehicle will also remain in good condition. Quality checks of the vehicles can also reduce fuel consumption and increase performance.Above all, the government is taking some major steps to minimize pollution. Electric buses and trains run in the entire city to reduce the use of diesel buses as public transport. Furthermore, the installation of CNG( Compressed Natural Gas) engines is mandatory. This would reduce the cost of transportation and will not be harmful to the environment.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major cause of vehicle pollution is the rapid increase in the number of vehicles. Over the last few decades, most vehicles have been produced. The population of vehicles was about 1.4 billion in 2020 itself. The rapid growth in vehicles means more fuel is required which results in the emission of harmful gases in the environment that causes air pollution. Other major factors that contribute to the increase in vehicular pollution in urban areas are poor fuel quality, use of old vehicles, congested traffic which results in smog, no proper traffic management, two-stroke engines, no proper maintenance of vehicles.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a world where everything is transported by the use of vehicles, so it is necessary to have knowledge about vehicle pollution. But before that let us talk about pollution. Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Similarly, vehicle pollution is the introduction of harmful pollutants into the environment by motor vehicles.The pollutants introduced have several effects on human health and the symptoms include cough, nausea, headache, irritation in the eye, and visibility problems. As the population increases, the purchasing power of the people also increases therefore everyone has a vehicle these days for transportation which is very bad for the environment.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly one half of everyone living in the United States—an estimated 150 million—live in areas that don’t meet federal air quality standards. Passenger vehicles and heavy-duty trucks are a major source of this pollution, which includes ozone, particulate matter, and other smog-forming emissions.The health risks of air pollution are extremely serious. Poor air quality increases respiratory ailments like asthma and bronchitis, heightens the risk of life-threatening conditions like cancer, and burdens our health care system with substantial medical costs. Particulate matter is singlehandedly responsible for up to 30,000 premature deaths each year.</p>
    <h5>“Less air pollution is the answer to a healthy life solution.Breathe healthy and be healthy.Prevent air pollution, protect nature.”</h5>

    <hr><br><h3>Choloroflourocarbons(CFCs):</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are nontoxic, nonflammable chemicals containing atoms of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine. They are used in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, blowing agents for foams and packing materials, as solvents, and as refrigerants. CFCs are classified as halocarbons, a class of compounds that contain atoms of carbon and halogen atoms. Individual CFC molecules are labeled with a unique numbering system. For example, the CFC number of 11 indicates the number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, and chlorine (e.g. CCl3F as CFC-11). The best way to remember the system is the "rule of 90" or add 90 to the CFC number where the first digit is the number of carbon atoms (C), the second digit is the number of hydrogen atoms (H), and the third digit is number of the fluorine atoms (F). The total number of chlorine atoms (Cl) are calculated by the expression: Cl = 2(C+1) - H - F. In the example CFC-11 has one carbon, no hydrogen, one fluorine, and therefore 3 chlorine atoms.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refrigerators in the late 1800s and early 1900s used the toxic gases, ammonia (NH3), methyl chloride (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), as refrigerants. After a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s when methyl chloride leaked out of refrigerators, a search for a less toxic replacement begun as a collaborative effort of three American corporations- Frigidaire, General Motors, and Du Pont. CFCs were first synthesized in 1928 by Thomas Midgley, Jr. of General Motors, as safer chemicals for refrigerators used in large commercial appilications1. Frigidaire was issued the first patent, number 1,886,339, for the formula for CFCs on December 31, 1928. In 1930, General Motors and Du Pont formed the Kinetic Chemical Company to produce Freon (a Du Pont tradename for CFCs) in large quantities. By 1935 Frigidaire and its competitors had sold 8 million new refrigerators in the United States using Freon-12 (CFC-12) made by the Kinetic Chemical Company and those companies that were licensed to manufacture this compound. In 1932 the Carrier Engineering Corporation used Freon-11 (CFC-11) in the worldís first self-contained home air-conditioning unit, called the "Atmospheric Cabinet".; Because of the CFC safety record for nontoxicity, Freon became the preferred coolant in large air-conditioning systems. Public health codes in many American cities were revised to designate Freon as the only coolant that could be used in public buildings. After World War II, CFCs were used as propellants for bug sprays, paints, hair conditioners, and other health care products. During the late 1950s and early 1960s the CFCs made possible an inexpensive solution to the desire for air conditioning in many automobiles, homes, and office buildings. Later, the growth in CFC use took off worldwide with peak, annual sales of about a billion dollars (U.S.) and more than one million metric tons of CFCs produced.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a growing concern over stratospheric ozone depletion and its attendant dangers, a ban was imposed on the use of CFCs in aerosol-spray dispensers in the late 1970s by the United States, Canada, and the Scandinavian countries. In 1990, 93 nations agreed, as part of the Montreal Protocol (established 1987), to end production of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the 20th century. By 1992 the list of participating countries had grown to 140, and the timetable for ending production of CFCs advanced to 1996. This goal has largely been met. HCFCs pose less of a risk than CFCs because they decompose more readily in the lower atmosphere; nevertheless, they too degrade the ozone layer and are scheduled to be phased out by 2030.</p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/36/130836-050-5711B4D7/use-chlorofluorocarbons-propellants-places-Canada-Scandinavia.jpg" alt="loading the image" height="300" width="600">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004200/a004272/world_avoided_robinson.1830_print.jpg" alt="loading the image" height="300" width="600">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the atmospheric impacts of CFCs are not limited to their role as ozone-depleting chemicals. Infrared absorption bands prevent heat at that wavelength from escaping the earth’s atmosphere. CFCs have their strongest absorption bands from C-F and C-Cl bonds in the spectral region of 7.8–15.3 µm—referred to as “atmospheric window” due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region.The strength of CFC absorption bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere at wavelengths where CFCs (indeed all covalent fluorine compounds) absorb creates a “super” greenhouse gas (GHG) effect from CFCs and other unreactive fluorine-containing gases such as perfluorocarbons, HFCs, HCFCs, bromofluorocarbons.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>Industrial Development(Air Pollution):</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of technology and manufacturing, industries are developing, and they are the major cause of degradation of the environment, which in turn is a key factor in turning extreme weather events into natural disasters. Any form of pollution which has its source from industrial practises is known as industrial pollution. Industrial pollution has its severe impact on the environment and is causing various types of pollution, such as air pollution, water pollution, thermal pollution and noise pollution.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke containing undesirable gases like carbon dioxide, Sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide coming out from the industries causes air pollution.The untreated water from the industries is released into water bodies, causing water pollution.Lack of effective policies and poor enforcement drive also aids industrial pollution.The unplanned industrial growth also leads to air and water pollution.Most Industries rely on old Technologies to produce products that generate a large amount of wastes, which ultimately cause pollution and lead to environment degradation.Many small scale industries do not have enough capital to treat their wastes properly and hence lead to the environmental pollution.Extraction of a lot of raw materials from the ground can also lead to soil or land pollution</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various causes of industrial pollution. Smoke containing undesirable gases like carbon dioxide, Sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide coming out from the industries causes air pollution. The untreated water from the industries is released into water bodies, causing water pollution. Lack of effective policies and poor enforcement drive also aids industrial pollution. Air pollution is brought about by harmful gases and undesirable particles like sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Airborne particulate materials contain strong and fluid particles like residue, showers, fog, and smoke. Water pollution is brought about by natural and inorganic modern squanders and effluents released into waterways. Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling. With the rise of industrial pollution, greenhouse gases are increasing in the environment and leading to global warming. Ultimately, global warming is causing melting of glaciers, floods, tsunamis, extinction of various animals, etc. Hence, there is an urgent need to deal with industrial pollution.</p>

    <p>Industrial pollution has continued to be a major factor causing degradation of the environment around us, affecting the water we use, the air we breathe, and the soil we live on. The exponential increase in industrialization not only consumes large areas of agricultural lands but also simultaneously causes serious environmental degradation of soil. Water originating from various industries finds its place in agriculture. The challenge is to properly incorporate the disposal of the wastes in a controlled management program so that the applied industrial solid wastes do not contribute pollution to soil, soil microbes, or the environment. To stop pollution and prevent metal toxicity, there is a clear need for an overall waste treatment strategy with the goal of eliminating priority pollutants at their source. This can be achieved by indigenous microorganisms found in various industrial effluents that can be used as an indicator of pollution and to resist, process, metabolize, and detoxify chromate-polluted wastewater.</p>

    <hr><br><h3>Agriculture:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agriculture produces a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute greatly to global warming and climate change. Stable and radioisotopes can be used to develop technology packages that assist Member States to sustainably reduce these emissions, improve resource use efficiency and increase crop and animal productivity.Agriculture is both a victim of and a contributor to climate change. On the one hand, agricultural activities contribute approximately 30 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, mainly due to the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and animal wastes. This rate is bound to further rise as a result of an increase in the demand for food by a growing global population, the stronger demand for dairy and meat products, and the intensification of agricultural practices.On the other hand, these greenhouses gases include nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which all contribute to climate change and global warming and thereby have a profound impact on the sustainability of agricultural production systems. This does not yet take into account the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of pesticide, the environmental cost of which is largely unrecognized.Together with the FAO, the IAEA aims to optimise and strengthen the capacities of Member States in using nuclear and isotopic techniques so they can develop technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the intensification of crop production and the preservation of natural resources.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carbon-13 stable isotope technique, using the natural abundance of carbon-13 in the environment, allows researchers to evaluate soil quality and sources of carbon sequestered in the soil. This helps identify how various combinations of crop rotation, tillage and ground cover can enhance productivity and improve the efficiency with which increasingly scarce resources, such as water and chemical nutrients, are used.Carbon sequestration – the capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in soil – currently presents the best solution to counterbalance the increase of greenhouse gases. This includes enhancing biomass production; the application of low-cost plant growth regulators and bio-fertilizers; agricultural conservation practices (no till, application of manure and biochar); nitrogen fixation by leguminous crops; reduced pesticide use; crop rotation; and mixed crop-livestock production. In addition, optimised animal feeding practices and manure management can reduce energy leakage and emissions.To improve animal productivity and protect the environment from overgrazing, nuclear and related techniques can help formulate feed supplementation strategies. One way is to identify the combination of long chain hydrocarbon and natural carbon-13 on plants eaten by ruminants and in their faeces, which helps estimate their intake under grazing or grassland browsing conditions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food system CO2 emissions are somewhat harder to quantify, due to the distinct processes through which they are generated and difficulty in applying uniform accounting methods or sectoral boundaries. A small amount of CO2 emissions occur directly from agricultural production, following the application of urea and lime, but these sources constitute an extremely small portion of total CO2 emissions. Energy-use CO2 from either agricultural operations (e.g., tractor fuel) or embedded in inputs (e.g., fertilizer manufacture and transport) can also be included as food system emissions, but are highly uncertain (Vermeulen et al., 2012), and are considered as energy or transport emissions within the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) accounting framework. The routes to reducing most of these emission sources are likely to be in the overall decarbonization of energy generation, rather than specific agricultural mitigations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus on reducing (to net zero) our CO2 emissions is well justified not just because it is the major anthropogenic climate forcer but also because it acts cumulatively. Shorter-lived greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide will, by definition, automatically be removed from the atmosphere over a shorter timeframe, so emissions will not continue to act cumulatively over the very long term that CO2 will. There follows two key implications for shorter-lived greenhouse gases in relation to CO2.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decreasing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions is important—net food system CO2 emissions must be eliminated, as with all other CO2 emissions, and reducing agricultural methane and N2O, while distinct from CO2, is climatically beneficial and must be encouraged. Atmospheric concentrations of both methane (Nisbet et al., 2019) and N2O (Tian et al., 2020) resemble their “worst-case” representative concentration pathways (RCPs). To achieve the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement, all sectors must make large-scale, rapid efforts to decrease their emissions of all gases (Rogelj et al., in press). Insufficient agricultural emission reductions will compromise our ability to limit global warming to 1.5 (Leahy et al., 2020), and current trajectories for food system emissions threaten this target by themselves (Clark et al., 2020).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the emission of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 300 times larger than that of carbon dioxide, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and manure must be used conscientiously. Additionally, low-cost inhibitors that regulate nitrogen processes in soils should be implemented. All this requires detailed knowledge of the sources of greenhouse gas production through the various microbial processes in soil.Nuclear techniques offer substantial advantages over conventional techniques for measuring the impact of climate change. Using the nitrogen-15 isotopic technique, scientists can identify the source of nitrous oxide production, which is important to find ways to reduce the emission of the gas.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>Overpopulation:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overpopulation is a root cause of climate change. The links between the two problems are undeniable, and reducing the rate of population growth is crucial to bringing global warming under control. But governments and international organizations are reluctant even to acknowledge overpopulation as an important factor in diagnosing the problem. Without concerted action on population issues, the dire predictions of Thomas Robert Malthus are likely to come into play.Two of the major concerns facing the world today are overpopulation and climate change. While at first glance these two issues may appear unrelated, the truth is that they are inextricably linked. Overpopulation is directly contributing to climate change, and that, in turn, is causing devastating effects, especially in communities with less wealth. Recognizing the relationship of overpopulation to climate change is key to solving both issues. Overpopulation is filling our dumps with plastic, overpopulation is causing deforestation across the world, overpopulation is causing massive pollution by dependence on fossil fuels. Overpopulation means more factory farms, more consumption and the earth cannot handle much more. In my humble opinion, one can’t address climate change without addressing sustainable populations. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive increase in world population in the 20th century was the fastest in human history. It came on the heels of the Industrial Revolution, and the combination of the two factors led to a huge increase in carbon emissions. The carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere in 1950 was around 300 parts per million, but just under 70 years later, that number had increased to 400 parts per million. This is a huge increase in a geologically minuscule period. During that same time, the world’s population increased by over 5 billion. These two facts are closely related.People need food to survive, and as the world’s population grows, so too does the demand for food. To meet this demand, agricultural development has caused deforestation on a large scale. The shrinking forests are unable to counteract the effects of the increasing carbon emissions, causing temperatures to rise. This, in turn, has caused desertification, especially in the already vulnerable Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The resulting loss of arable land means less food production, which threatens to leave millions undernourished. A related problem is water scarcity, caused by increased salinization and the drying up of rivers, lakes, and streams.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 2 billion people to be added to our human ranks by 2050 and an additional 1 billion more by 2100, demographic trends and variables play an important role in understanding and confronting the world’s climate crisis. Population growth, along with increasing consumption, tends to increase emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases. Rapid population growth worsens the impacts of climate change by straining resources and exposing more people to climate-related risks—especially in low-resource regions.Including population dynamics in climate change-related education and advocacy can help clarify why access to reproductive health care, family planning options, girls’ education, and gender equity should be included in climate interventions. Increased investment in health and education, along with improvements in infrastructure and land use, would strengthen climate resilience and build adaptive capacity for people around the world.Earth’s warmest years on record were from 2015 to 2019, capping off a long-term warming trend. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that human emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, have raised the global average temperature by close to 1°C (nearly 2°F) above pre-industrial levels.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the number of people being born is not a panacea for climate change, but it cuts future carbon emissions, effectively, simply and permanently, and it boosts the effectiveness of other solutions.Theories of overpopulation have been offered as supposedly "natural" laws to explain resource scarcity and justify population control—a scarcity that is, in fact, often the product of a system focused almost exclusively on profits and not societal needs. An economic and governance system that focuses on broader social benefits, instead of emphasizing corporate profits and an extractive framework, would go a long way towards addressing the root causes of scarcity.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s estimated that more than 200 million people worldwide will be displaced by the climate emergency by 2050.  Climate refugees can already be found in the United States. In the face of rising sea levels, subsiding land and frequent flood events, the south Louisiana residents of Isle de Jean Charles need to move to higher, safer ground. With the loss of more than 98% of the community’s land over the past 60 years, resettlement is inevitable. Also, Native Alaska Indigenous communities are being displaced by coastal erosion due to thawing permafrost and increasing exposure to storm surges due to sea ice loss.Not only must we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow the amount and speed of the impending climate crisis, but we must also take action to reduce our vulnerability to the harms caused by the current and future impacts of climate change. Gender equity and empowerment initiatives are two important climate mitigation and adaptation strategies noted by Project Drawdown, a nonprofit leader working to reduce emissions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the climate is changing as a result of global warming; and if global warming is largely attributable to human activity; and if that human activity has included polluting the atmosphere with greenhouse gases and over-consuming natural resources by an ever-increasing population – why not connect the dots and accept the obvious? Overpopulation is not just a contributor to climate change, but a root cause of the problem.Yes, we all need to reduce our carbon footprints, but time is running out. As the Center for Biological Diversity states, in the quest to survive climate change “we not only need smaller footprints, but fewer feet.”</p>

    <br><h3>Volcanoes:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volcanic eruptions are often discussed in relation to climate change because they release CO2 (and other gases) into our atmosphere. However, human contributions to the carbon cycle are more than 100 times those from all the volcanoes in the world - combined.In comparison, while volcanic eruptions do cause an increase in atmospheric CO2, human activities emit a Mount St. Helens-sized eruption of CO2 every 2.5 hours and a Mount Pinatubo-sized eruption of CO2 twice daily.The largest possible eruptions come from super volcanoes like Yellowstone or Mount Toba (which erupt very rarely, about every 100,000 to 200,000 years or more), but the total annual CO2 emissions from human activities is like one or more Yellowstone-sized super eruptions going off every year.Essentially, CO2 emissions from human activities dwarf those of volcanoes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gases and dust particles thrown into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions have influences on climate. Most of the particles spewed from volcanoes cool the planet by shading incoming solar radiation. The cooling effect can last for months to years depending on the characteristics of the eruption. Volcanoes have also caused global warming over millions of years during times in Earth’s history when extreme amounts of volcanism occurred, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Even though volcanoes are in specific places on Earth, their effects can be more widely distributed as gases, dust, and ash get into the atmosphere. Because of atmospheric circulation patterns, eruptions in the tropics can have an effect on the climate in both hemispheres while eruptions at mid or high latitudes only have impact the hemisphere they are within.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons that large volcanic eruptions have such far-reaching effects on global climate. First, volcanic eruptions produce major quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2), a gas known to contribute to the greenhouse effect. Such greenhouse gases trap heat radiated off of the surface of the earth forming a type of insulation around the planet. The greenhouse effect is essential for our survival because it maintains the temperature of our planet within a habitable range. Nevertheless, there is growing concern that our production of gases such as CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels may be pushing the system a little too far, resulting in excessive warming on a global scale. There is no doubt that volcanic eruptions add CO2 to the atmosphere, but compared to the quantity produced by human activities, their impact is virtually trivial: volcanic eruptions produce about 110 million tons of CO2 each year, whereas human activities contribute almost 10,000 times that quantity.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmospheric effects of volcanic eruptions were confirmed by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines. Pinatubos eruption cloud reached over 40 kilometers into the atmosphere and ejected about 17 million tons of SO2, just over two times that of El Chichn in 1982. The sulfur-rich aerosols circled the globe within three weeks and produced a global cooling effect approximately twice that of El Chichn. The Northern Hemisphere cooled by up to 0.6 degrees C during 1992 and 1993. Moreover, the aerosol particles may have contributed to an accelerated rate of ozone depletion during that same period. Interestingly, some scientists argue that without the cooling effect of major volcanic eruptions such as El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo, global warming effects caused by human activities would have been far more substantial.Major volcanic eruptions have additional climatic effects beyond global temperature decreases and acid rain. Ash and aerosol particles suspended in the atmosphere scatter light of red wavelengths, often resulting in brilliantly colored sunsets and sunrises around the world. The spectacular optical effects of the 1883 Krakatau eruption cloud were observed across the globe, and may have inspired numerous artists and writers in their work. The luminous, vibrant renderings of the fiery late day skyline above the Thames River in London by the British painter William Ascroft, for instance, may be the result of the distant Krakatau eruption.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>Water Vapour:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water vapor is Earth’s most abundant greenhouse gas. It’s responsible for about half of Earth’s greenhouse effect — the process that occurs when gases in Earth’s atmosphere trap the Sun’s heat. Greenhouse gases keep our planet livable. Without them, Earth’s surface temperature would be about 59 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) colder. Water vapor is also a key part of Earth’s water cycle: the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth’s atmosphere, land, and ocean as liquid water, solid ice, and gaseous water vapor.Since the late 1800s, global average surface temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Data from satellites, weather balloons, and ground measurements confirm the amount of atmospheric water vapor is increasing as the climate warms. (The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report states total atmospheric water vapor is increasing 1 to 2% per decade.) For every degree Celsius that Earth’s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water vapour is the most dominant greenhouse gas. The greenhouse effect or radiative flux for water is around 75 W/m2while carbon dioxide contributes 32 W/m2. These proportions are confirmed by measurements of infrared radiation returning to the Earth's surface . Water vapour is also the dominant positive feedback in our climate system and a major reason why temperature is so sensitive to changes in CO2.Unlike external forcings such as CO2 which can be added to the atmosphere, the level of water vapour in the atmosphere is a function of temperature. Water vapour is brought into the atmosphere via evaporation - the rate depends on the temperature of the ocean and air, being governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. If extra water is added to the atmosphere, it condenses and falls as rain or snow within a week or two. Similarly, if somehow moisture was sucked out of the atmosphere, evaporation would restore water vapour levels to 'normal levels' in short time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of water vapour to the atmosphere, for the most part, cannot be directly attributed to human generated activities. Increased water vapor content in the atmosphere is referred to as a feedback process. Warmer air is able to hold more moisture. As the climate warms, air temperatures rise, more evaporation from water sources and land occurs, thus increasing the atmospheric moisture content. The increase in water vapour in the atmosphere, because water vapour is an effective greenhouse gas, thus contributes to even more warming: it enhances the greenhouse effect.Water vapour is often discussed and recognized as being an important part of the global warming process. The water vapour feedback process is most likely responsible for a doubling of the greenhouse effect when compared to the addition of carbon dioxide on its own.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold is dependent on temperature. Under normal conditions, most of the heat emitted from Earth’s surface in the form of long wave radiation goes into the atmosphere and out into space.  However, the presence of increased greenhouse gases traps more long-wave radiation, which means there is more energy in the atmosphere to warm the Earth’s surface.As the atmospheric temperature rises, more water is evaporated from ground storage, such as that found in our rivers, oceans, soils, and reservoirs. The released water vapor becomes a greenhouse gas where it then absorbs more energy radiated from the Earth and thus warms the atmosphere. The warmer atmosphere results in further water evaporation and the cycle continues. This mechanism is known as a Positive Feedback Loop.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>Melting Permafrost:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permafrost is made of a combination of soil, rocks and sand that are held together by ice. The soil and ice in permafrost stay frozen all year long.Near the surface, permafrost soils also contain large quantities of organic carbon—a material leftover from dead plants that couldn’t decompose, or rot away, due to the cold. Lower permafrost layers contain soils made mostly of minerals.A layer of soil on top of permafrost does not stay frozen all year. This layer, called the active layer, thaws during the warm summer months and freezes again in the fall. In colder regions, the ground rarely thaws—even in the summer. There, the active layer is very thin—only 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters). In warmer permafrost regions, the active layer can be several meters thick.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Earth’s climate warms, the permafrost is thawing. That means the ice inside the permafrost melts, leaving behind water and soil.Thawing permafrost can have dramatic impacts on our planet and the things living on it. For example:Many northern villages are built on permafrost. When permafrost is frozen, it’s harder than concrete. However, thawing permafrost can destroy houses, roads and other infrastructure.When permafrost is frozen, plant material in the soil—called organic carbon—can’t decompose, or rot away. As permafrost thaws, microbes begin decomposing this material. This process releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.When permafrost thaws, so do ancient bacteria and viruses in the ice and soil. These newly-unfrozen microbes could make humans and animals very sick. Scientists have discovered microbes more than 400,000 years old in thawed permafrost.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paper published earlier this year in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment looked at the current state of permafrost research. Along with highlighting conclusions about permafrost thaw, the paper focuses on how researchers are seeking to address the questions surrounding it.Infrastructure is already affected: Thawing permafrost has led to giant sinkholes, slumping telephone poles, damaged roads and runways, and toppled trees. More difficult to see is what has been trapped in permafrost’s mix of soil, ice, and dead organic matter. Research has looked at how chemicals like DDT and microbes – some of which have been frozen for thousands, if not millions, of years – could be released from thawing permafrost.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arctic is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change and it has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest of the world over the past forty years. The new study focuses on Arctic lakes located in the sporadic permafrost region of northern Sweden. In this area —a typical tundra ecosystem— between 10 and 50% of the soils are permanently frozen. The top layer of the soil above the permafrost —the active layer— is the one that freezes and thaws annually."In this region, the average annual temperature has risen considerably in recent years and is now above 0ºC. This causes permafrost —with its abundant organic matter rich in carbon and greenhouse gases— to thaw. Through the circulation of groundwater, the thawing permafrost acts as a spring that supplies the hydrologically connected lakes in the region with greenhouse gases. The gases are finally emitted into the atmosphere and contribute to amplifying global warming", says lecturer Carolina Olid.To date, the effects of permafrost thawing in groundwater discharge into Arctic lakes and its relevance on greenhouse gas emissions were still unknown and had not been studied in detail. To answer these questions, the team used radon —a gas abundant in subsoil currents— as a tracer of groundwater discharge into the lakes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still difficult to determine those areas of the planet where the process of permafrost melting will be more pronounced or faster. In some areas, some lakes will dry up because the water will flow out through the drains or new channels formed by the melting. In other cases, the lakes will expand their margins as the melting progresses —a process known as thermokarst— and new lakes will emerge in relief depressions.In this scenario of climate uncertainty, the introduction of groundwater discharge into climate models will improve predictions of future methane emissions from lakes."This will allow us to assess the real role of lakes in the carbon cycle and whether they really function as sources or as potential reservoirs of greenhouse gases. This information is key to developing appropriate conservation policies to mitigate climate change".There are four ways to describe the distribution of permafrost: continuous, discontinuous, isolated, and sporadic permafrost.  Continuous permafrost represents an area where frozen soil underlies larger than 90 % of the surface. It is usually found in the coldest areas like part of Siberia. Discontinuous permafrost is usually found in an area where frozen soils lie beneath 50 to 90 % of the surface. Southern Hudson Bay, Canada, has discontinuous permafrost. Sporadic permafrost occurs when frozen soils lie behind 10 to 50 % of the surface. In isolated permafrost, the frozen soils underlie below 10 % of the surface.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>Forest Blazes:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vice versa condition in which forest fires can cause climate chang eand as well climate change or global warming may lead to forest fires.Climate change has been a key factor in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the Western United States. Wildfire risk depends on a number of factors, including temperature, soil moisture, and the presence of trees, shrubs, and other potential fuel. All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate variability and climate change. Climate change enhances the drying of organic matter in forests (the material that burns and spreads wildfire), and has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.Research shows that changes in climate create warmer, drier conditions. Increased drought, and a longer fire season are boosting these increases in wildfire risk. For much of the U.S. West, projections show that an average annual 1 degree C temperature increase would increase the median burned area per year as much as 600 percent in some types of forests. In the Southeastern United States modeling suggests increased fire risk and a longer fire season, with at least a 30 percent increase from 2011 in the area burned by lightning-ignited wildfire by 2060.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ever-increasing problem of forest fire risks has intrigued researchers globally to find a mechanism that can provide an early warning of forest fire incidents as well as assess the extent of spatial-temporal damage caused by them. Further information and data on its impacts would help in mitigating the disaster through advanced planning and management. The effects of forest fire have been known for a long time, but due to limited data, mitigation measures were always hampered. With the advancement of technology in the recent past with respect to high-resolution satellite data, a programming interface, and the development of mobile applications to a certain extent, it is now possible to predict forest fires and to study the impacts at local, regional, and global levels. Several open satellite data sets available from NASA, NOAA, and COPERNICUS have facilitated the quantification of various variables in near real time. Further the easy access to open-source data facilitated in the development of user-friendly web interfaces and APPS to continuously monitor the spatio-temporal changes caused as a result of forest fires on the ecosystem and on climate.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extreme wildfires sweeping across parts of North America, Europe and Siberia this year are not only wreaking local damage and sending choking smoke downwind. They are also affecting the climate itself in important ways that will long outlast their flames.Wildfires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that will continue to warm the planet well into the future. They damage forests that would otherwise remove CO2 from the air. And they inject soot and other aerosols into the atmosphere, with complex effects on warming and cooling.To be sure, the leading cause of global warming remains overwhelmingly the burning of fossil fuels. That warming lengthens the fire season, drying and heating the forests. In turn, blazes like those scorching areas across the Northern Hemisphere this summer have a feedback effect—a vicious cycle when the results of warming produce yet more warming.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States during the last two decades. Wildfires require the alignment of a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, and the lack of moisture in fuels, such as trees, shrubs, grasses, and forest debris. All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate variability and climate change.A 2016 study found climate change enhanced the drying of organic matter and doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015offsite link in the western United States. A 2021 study supported by NOAA concluded that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in fire weatheroffsite link in the western United States.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildfires are unplanned fires that burn in forests, grasslands and other ecosystems, and they can start with a natural event like a lightning strike, or as the result of human activity. Campfires, discarded cigarettes, and electrical equipment like downed power lines all spark wildfires.But climate change can make environments more susceptible to burning. Increasing severe heat and drought due to climate change can fuel wildfires.Hotter temperatures evaporate more moisture from soil and vegetation, drying out trees, shrubs and grasses and turning leaf litter and fallen branches into kindling.</p>

    <ul>
    <br><h3>There are mainly five types of effects:</h3>
    <ul><br><li>1.Rise in temperature</li>
    <li>2.Threats to the Ecosystem</li>
    <li>3.Spread of Diseases</li>
    <li>4.High Mortality Rates</li>
    <li>5.Loss of Natural Habitat</li></ul>
    <br><h3>1.Rise in temperature:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most immediate and obvious consequences of global warming is the increase in temperatures around the world. The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) over the past 100 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).Temperature is the measure of the average heat or thermal energy in a substance. Air and water temperatures are primarily determined by the amount of sunlight that is absorbed by the surface of the Earth, and the amount of heat that is re-radiated in the atmosphere by the greenhouse gases. Atmospheric and ocean circulation redistribute heat across the surface of the Earth and shape regional temperature patterns.The increase in greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels, agricultural activities, and deforestation, which has caused global average air temperatures to increase. Around 90% of this excess atmospheric heat is absorbed by the ocean, thereby increasing average ocean temperatures.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of asphalt and other dark colored materials in urban areas can dramatically increase the amount of sunlight absorbed. This creates what are called urban heat islands, whereby cities experience higher temperatures than surrounding areas.The burning of fossil fuels as well as fires lit deliberately to remove trees to clear land for agricultural activities or ignited by accident, release airborne particles into the atmosphere. Dark colored particles that absorb sunlight have a warming effect, while light colored particles that reflect or scatter sunlight have a cooling effect.Over much longer time periods — tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years — changes in Earth’s spin, tilt, and orbit, periodically increase and decrease the amount of sunlight absorbed by different areas of the Earth’s surface.Over millions of years changes in the carbon cycle, including the rates of weathering and volcanic activity, alter the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which affect Earth’s average temperature.Over millions of years changes in the distribution of continents alters how much sunlight is absorbed by the land or ocean.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming has led to an incredible increase in earth's temperature. Since 1880, the earth's temperature has increased by ~1 degrees. This has resulted in an increase in the melting of glaciers, which have led to an increase in the sea level. This could have devastating effects on coastal regions.Human influences are the number one cause of global warming, especially the carbon pollution we cause by burning fossil fuels and the pollution capture we prevent by destroying forests. The carbon dioxide, methane, soot, and other pollutants we release into the atmosphere act like a blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm. Evidence shows that the 2010s were hotter than any other decade on record—and every decade since the 1960s has averaged hotter than the previous one. This warming is altering the earth's climate system, including its land, atmosphere, oceans, and ice, in far-reaching ways.</p>    
    <hr><br><h3>2.Threats to the Ecosystem:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main driver of biodiversity loss remains humans’ use of land – primarily for food production. Human activity has already altered over 70 per cent of all ice-free land. When land is converted for agriculture, some animal and plant species may lose their habitat and face extinction.But climate change is playing an increasingly important role in the decline of biodiversity. Climate change has altered marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems around the world. It has caused the loss of local species, increased diseases, and driven mass mortality of plants and animals, resulting in the first climate-driven extinctions.On land, higher temperatures have forced animals and plants to move to higher elevations or higher latitudes, many moving towards the Earth’s poles, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems. The risk of species extinction increases with every degree of warming.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When human activities produce greenhouse gases, around half of the emissions remain in the atmosphere, while the other half is absorbed by the land and ocean. These ecosystems – and the biodiversity they contain – are natural carbon sinks, providing so-called nature-based solutions to climate change.Protecting, managing, and restoring forests, for example, offers roughly two-thirds of the total mitigation potential of all nature-based solutions. Despite massive and ongoing losses, forests still cover more than 30 per cent of the planet’s land.Peatlands – wetlands such as marshes and swamps – cover only 3 per cent of the world’s land, but they store twice as much carbon as all the forests. Preserving and restoring peatlands means keeping them wet so the carbon doesn’t oxidize and float off into the atmosphere.Ocean habitats such as seagrasses and mangroves can also sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates up to four times higher than terrestrial forests can. Their ability to capture and store carbon make mangroves highly valuable in the fight against climate change.Conserving and restoring natural spaces, both on land and in the water, is essential for limiting carbon emissions and adapting to an already changing climate. About one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions needed in the next decade could be achieved by improving nature’s ability to absorb emissions.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientific research continues to refine the understanding of Earth's climate system and its interdependence on the biosphere. For the most part, projections indicate an increased likelihood of negative consequences of climate change for ecosystems and people. Indeed, climate-related impacts are already being witnessed and seem to be increasing in severity and frequency. A number of potential climate tipping points in the Earth system are already showing early signs of activation. Consequently, the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5°C (https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) warns that allowing the planet to warm beyond 1.5°C will result in climate change impacts, including drought, floods, heat waves and sea-level rise, that are deleterious for humanity and for biodiversity. While the previous internationally agreed target was 2°C, this half-degree difference could reduce the risk of extensive degradation of Arctic and coral reef ecosystems. A 1.5°C maximum warming ambition implies that the world has about 12 years to reduce global net carbon emissions by half to avoid the most significant impacts, but even if this target is achieved, potential impacts of warming are likely to continue for decades or even centuries.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major challenge in understanding and implementing nature-based approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation is that of scalability. Climate change is a global problem, requiring multi-jurisdictional and multinational governance, yet many of the examples of NbS concern proof of concept studies over relatively small spatial scales. Additional benefits of solutions can be quite significant and may overcome the opportunity costs. The costs and benefits of solutions, as well as the problem itself, are inequitable across social groups. How can institutions be designed so that those who benefit are empowered to implement management actions? If the global community invests in local solutions in poor communities, there can be local and global benefits. There may be innovative opportunities for scaling, e.g. working with existing rural social protection programmes, or local fisheries management programmes, and many examples of good practice are emerging.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>3.Spread of Diseases:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming is an unequivocal phenomenon today. Global warming is one of the components of climate change, and it induces considerable impacts on human health. The emerging evidence of the effect of global warming on human health has been summarized in the fourth report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).1 The effect of global warming on human health is divided into two categories: direct effect on the illness such as heat shock and increased mortality in population with other diseases and indirect effect on diseases such as infectious diseases and allergy. The IPCC report states that climate change has altered the distribution of some infectious disease vectors, the seasonal distribution of some allergenic pollen species, and increased heat wave-related deaths. In the present review, the effect of global warming on infectious diseases is addressed. Furthermore, current research on the effect of global warming on infectious diseases is introduced.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infectious diseases are caused by organisms that make us sick, also known as pathogens. Many viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are pathogens. Each type of pathogenic organism has climatic conditions it prefers. Changes in weather patterns that favor the conditions needed by a pathogen―particularly in terms of average temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity―will positively affect its ability to survive and spread. Conditions that favor the animals (such as rodents, mosquitos, and ticks) that support pathogen reproduction and transmission will also help some infectious diseases spread.Furthermore, as the climate warms, extreme weather events like heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts are becoming more common and more intense. These extreme events can create conditions that are favorable for disease spread. Extreme weather events that displace people, including floods and hurricanes, can also lead to circumstances that facilitate the spread of disease among people, such as through crowded conditions in emergency shelters and the disruption of healthcare services, including delays in routine childhood immunizations.</p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-022-02167-z/d41586-022-02167-z_23356934.jpg" alt="loading the image" height="300" width="600">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSErqBFhX0Zgg8TL9GSR_P9FyBCIdbW7XroiA&usqp=CAU" alt="loading the image" height="300" width="600">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to global warming, the lifecycles of pathogens and the animals that carry and transmit them are influenced by changes in land use and land cover. For example, in the parts of the world with the parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis, dam construction can create the still, freshwater habitats preferred by snails that harbor the parasite, leading to outbreaks of the disease. Deforestation is linked to increases in infectious disease outbreaks around the world, particularly in tropical countries.The spread of infectious disease agents is also affected by travel patterns. Air travel in particular makes it possible for an infectious disease agent to spread rapidly from area to area within a continent or from one continent to another. The speed at which this can happen was on display when the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged. The outbreak escalated from the first infections to a global pandemic in a few months.These factors are closely connected with the effectiveness of the health system, access to health care, and availability of medical treatments. Sewage treatment and water disinfection are critical for providing safe drinking water and preventing waterborne disease outbreaks from cholera and typhoid. Vaccinations, antibiotic medicines, and regular medical care can also help stem the spread of infectious diseases, but their accessibility and affordability depend heavily on socioeconomic status and distance to health services.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>4.High Mortality Rates:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a significant relationship between ambient temperature and mortality. In healthy individuals with no underlying co-morbid conditions, there is an efficient heat regulation system which enables the body to effectively handle thermal stress. However, in vulnerable groups, especially in elderly over the age of 65 years, infants and individuals with co-morbid cardiovascular and/or respiratory conditions, there is a deficiency in thermoregulation. When temperatures exceed a certain limit, being cold winter spells or heat waves, there is an increase in the number of deaths. In particular, it has been shown that at temperatures above 27 °C, the daily mortality rate increases more rapidly per degree rise compared to when it drops below 27 °C.This is especially of relevance with the current emergency of global warming. Besides the direct effect of temperature rises on human health, global warming will have a negative impact on primary producers and livestock, leading to malnutrition, which will in turn lead to a myriad of health related issues. This is further exacerbated by environmental pollution.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct and indirect effects of climate change place children at risk of mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, phobias, sleep disorders and substance abuse, which in turn can lead to adverse adult mental health outcomes and eventually contribute to an increase in mortality.nteractions between health, mortality and climate are very specific to individual location and latitude. There is a variation between populations in the optimum or threshold temperature, and may be a function of the adaptation to local climate. Generally, it has been shown that the warmer the climate, heat related mortality is detected at higher threshold temperatures. Similarly, residents in subtropical climates such as southern China are more vulnerable to cold spells. In cold climates effecting towns located in the North Polar area, heatwaves are detrimental to health to the same extent as cold spells, and in both scenarios, the adverse health effects of temperature extremes are delayed rather than immediate with time lags between the temperature wave and observed increase in mortality varying between 8 and 14 days </p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased release of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere as resulted in increased average temperature due to the greenhouse effect. This has lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality due to a cascade of adverse events. Of note is the increased rate of soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land and desertification, with the consequent loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems. The reduced fresh-water resources are leading to acidification of the oceans. Climate change is leading to a change in distribution of infectious diseases. Floods lead to more insect breeding sites, drive rodents from burrows, and contaminate clean water systems. These lead to increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections, and cryptosporidiosis.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the overall environmental pollution is leading to a rise in non-communicable and communicable disease. These include injuries and deaths during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, apart from the increased mortality during climate changes due to complications in chronically ill patients. The accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain can lead to the creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. Climate change is influencing the quantity and quality of food that is produced, as well as its equitable distribution. Low to middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable to a changing climate.</p>
    <hr><br><h3>5.Loss of Natural Habitat:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are not the only species impacted by our planet’s climate crisis. The world’s wildlife and habitats will also face profound, sometimes catastrophic, change. Increases in temperature could trigger the collapse of fragile ecosystems and huge waves of extinction. The choices we make today have the power to reduce the suffering of people and animals in the future.Humans are not the only species impacted by our planet’s climate crisis. The world’s wildlife and habitats will also face profound, sometimes catastrophic, change. Increases in temperature could trigger the collapse of fragile ecosystems and huge waves of extinction. The choices we make today have the power to reduce the suffering of people and animals in the future.The Earth is now about 1.1°C (2°F) warmer than it was in the 1800s. Based on current projections, global temperatures will rise by 2.7°C (4.8°F) by the end of the century. It’s impossible to predict exactly how long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns will affect our planet’s fragile, deeply entwined ecosystems. Changes in one area influence changes in other areas and animals will feel the impact. Some of the biggest climate-driven threats for wildlife include:Habitat loss: Rising temperatures affect vegetation, food sources, access to water and much more. Ecosystems may become uninhabitable for certain animals, forcing wildlife to migrate outside of their usual patterns in search of food and livable conditions, while causing other animals to die off.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, we have a powerful ally in our fight against climate change: animals and the ecosystems they are part of. The United Nations estimates that healthy ecosystems could account for 37% of the carbon reductions needed to limit global temperature rise.Healthy ecosystems with abundant plants and trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere and store it. So, preserving or restoring nature is a powerful tool in the race to stop climate change. Healthy ecosystems also filter water, buffer against flooding, reduce the impact of disasters, improve soil health and support rich biodiversity. Keystone species and nearly all animals play vital, sometimes invisible, roles in securing biodiversity and conserving habitats.</p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/en_mammals_unfcc.jpg" alt="loading the image" height="300" width="600">

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habitat loss could accelerate to a level that brings about rapid extinctions of already vulnerable species. Shrinking ranges for mammals, amphibians and birds already account for an 18 percent loss of previous natural ranges, the study found, with a jump expected to reach 23 percent by this century's end.Global food demand currently fuels agricultural sectors to increase land use, moving into habitats previously untouched. What results — deforestation — leaves more carbon dioxide in the air, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change. In the U.S. alone, agriculture-related emissions measure 11.6 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tropics are biodiversity hotspots with lots of small-range species. If one hectare of tropical forest is converted to agricultural land, a lot more species lose larger proportions of their home than in places like Europe," said Dr. Robert Beyer of the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, one of the authors of the study.In many ways, the conclusion is already playing out in real time. Endangered orangutans have long been a noteworthy species dwindling in population due to their rainforest island ranges in Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia transforming into large-scale palm oil plantations. Farming and charcoal production have moved certain species of lemur — Madagascar's signature primate — into private reserves. And Amazon jaguars are increasingly difficult to spot as their ranges are cut into to ranch cattle."Whether these past trends in habitat range losses will reverse, continue, or accelerate will depend on future global carbon emissions and societal choices in the coming years and decades," study leader Andrea Manica, a professor at the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, explained.</p>
    <hr><br><h2 style="color: darkblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">4. How is Global Warming linked with extreme weather?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising global average temperature is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns. Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change.As Earth’s climate has warmed, a new pattern of more frequent and more intense weather events has unfolded around the world. Scientists identify these extreme weather events based on the historical record of weather in a particular region. They consider extreme weather events to be those that produce unusually high or low levels of rain or snow, temperature, wind, or other effects. Typically, these events are considered extreme if they are unlike 90% or 95% of similar weather events that happened before in that same area.Global warming can contribute to the intensity of heat waves by increasing the chances of very hot days and nights. Warming air also boosts evaporation, which can worsen drought. More drought creates dry fields and forests that are prone to catching fire, and increasing temperatures mean a longer wildfire season. Global warming also increases water vapor in the atmosphere, which can lead to more frequent heavy rain and snowstorms.71% of the 504 extreme weather events and trends included in the map were found to be made more likely or more severe by human-caused climate change.9% of events or trends were made less likely or less severe by climate change, meaning 80% of all events experienced some human impact. The remaining 20% of events and trends showed no discernible human influence or were inconclusive.Of the 152 extreme heat events that have been assessed by scientists, 93% found that climate change made the event or trend more likely or more severe.For the 126 rainfall or flooding events studied, 56% found human activity had made the event more likely or more severe. For the 81 drought events studied, it’s 68%.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangerous effects of heat waves, including death, occur as a result of both temperature and humidity — especially if those conditions persist for more than two days.With temperature records being smashed month after month, year after year, it's likely that human-caused global warming is making extreme heat events more frequent.Higher temperatures also boost evaporation, which dries out the soil in summer — intensifying drought over many areas.As more evaporation leads to more moisture in the atmosphere, rainfall intensifies. For example, we now know that the rainfall from Hurricane Harvey was 15 percent more intense and three times as likely to occur due to human-induced climate change.We expect to see a higher frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms, also, as temperatures continue to rise.Hurricanes are growing more powerful as global temperatures rise because these storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water.</p>
    <hr><br><h2 style="color: darkblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">5. Where does India stand in terms of Global Warming?</h2>
    <h3>India ranks fifth in national contribution to warming: Study</h3>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India is responsible for 0.08 degrees Celsius of warming from the 1850s through 2021, a new study estimated.India’s emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from 1851-2021 have resulted in 0.04°C, 0.03°C and 0.006°C of global warming over pre-industrial levels, respectively.Overall, the country ranks fifth among the top 10 contributors to warming, the research published in Scientific Data found.Researchers from Europe and the United States calculated national contributions to warming due to greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4 and N2O since the 1850s.“By focussing on the three gases that most countries include in their Nationally Determined Contributions, this dataset is uniquely positioned to informing climate policy and benchmarking,” Matthew Jones from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia, said in a statement.“It should become a living resource for continually tracking contributions to climate change and, more importantly, how those are changing,” the expert added.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their analysis showed that CO2 is responsible for 1.11°C of warming compared to methane’s 0.41°C and nitrous oxide’s 0.08°C.Further, the United States topped the list of countries, with a contribution of 0.28°C (17.3 per cent) of rise in temperature.China stood second with 0.20°C (12.3 per cent) of warming, followed by Russia’s 0.10°C (6.1 per cent), Brazil’s 0.08°C (4.9 per cent) and India’s 0.08°C (4.8 per cent).Indonesia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada each contributed 0.03-0.05°C of warming.The 2023 report covered an extensive gamut of subject assessments, ranging from climate change, agriculture and industry to water, plastics, forests and biodiversity.The report looked at states’ performances as well. “An alarmingly high number of states have slipped in their performance of SDGs 4, 8, 9, 10 and 15,” said Richard Mahapatra, managing editor of DTE and one of the editors of the SoE. These numbers refer to the goals on quality education; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; and life on land, respectively.</p>

    <hr><br><h2 style="color: darkblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">6. What are stas about Global Warming?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message could not be clearer: We need to do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right now. Unless we take major action to stop emissions, we’re facing an Earth that is hotter, plagued by more extreme weather, and less hospitable than the already-warmed planet we have today. Here’s everything you need to know about where we are with the climate crisis.At its core, climate change is really simple to grasp. The more carbon dioxide—and other warming gases—that we put into the atmosphere, the higher global temperatures will rise. Between 1850 and 2021, humans released around 2,500 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere (1 gigatonne equals 1 billion metric tons). So far, these emissions have led to 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming when compared to preindustrial levels.To have a 50-50 chance of staying under 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, we can release only 250 extra gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere—and that includes emissions from the beginning of 2023. To put that in perspective, in 2022 we emitted 36.8 gigatonnes of CO2, and global annual emissions are still yet to peak. In other words, we’ve blown our 1.5 degree budget—it’s just a matter of when, not if, we pass the threshold.By the same logic, other temperature thresholds have budgets, too. To have a 50-50 chance of keeping temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius of warming, we must emit fewer than 1,350 gigatonnes of CO2 from 2020 onwards. As of mid-2023, roughly only 1,000 gigatonnes of that budget remains.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You only need to think of recent devastating wildfires in Canada and Hawaii, the scorching temperatures in the southwestern United States, or the evacuation of tourists from Greece to see that climate change is leading to more frequent and more severe hot weather events.The kind of extreme heat event that had a likelihood of happening once every 10 years between 1850 and 1900 is now likely to occur 2.8 times every 10 years. In a world that hits 1.5 degrees of warming, such events are likely to occur 4.1 times every 10 years. The same is true of once-in-every-50-years events. They’re now likely to occur 4.8 times in 50 years, and in a world that exceeds 1.5 degrees of warming, 8.6 times every 50 years.Heavy rain is also more common because of climate change. The kind of heavy one-day rain that 150 years ago would have only happened once every 10 years is now happening 1.3 times every 10 years. In a world warmed by 1.5 degrees Celsius, that will go up to 1.5 times. And as frequency increases, so does severity—we can expect these extreme weather events to be hotter and wetter than those that went before them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among individuals.Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.Policies and laws addressing mitigation have consistently expanded since AR5. Global GHG emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced by October 2021 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and make it harder to limit warming below 2°C. There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented policies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of the levels needed to meet climate goals across all sectors and regions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high confidence). Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also to discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years.Adaptation options that are feasible and effective today will become constrained and less effective with increasing global warming. With increasing global warming, losses and damages will increase and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term planning and implementation of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and systems.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warmer climate increases public health challenges like heat-aggravated illnesses, vector borne diseases, and decreased access to safe water and food. Cutting short-lived climate pollutants can slow the rate of warming and lower public health risks.Short-lived climate pollutants like tropospheric ozone (O3) and black carbon (a component of fine particulate matter or PM2.5) are also dangerous air pollutants. Reducing them will prevent millions of premature deaths each year from air pollution. The biggest benefits will be felt in regions with high pollutant concentrations, with the greatest health benefits expected in Asia.Rising temperatures threaten food security through increases in pests and diseases and more frequent and intense droughts and floods. Heat-stress causes poor yields, or worse, crop failures. Reducing short-lived climate pollutants gives us our best chance to rapidly limit global temperature rise and reduce the risks to food security.Tropospheric ozone causes around 110 million tonnes in annual losses of the major staple crops: wheat, rice, maize and soybeans. This represents around 4% of the total annual global crop production, and up to 15% in some regions. Reducing methane, an ingredient in the formation of tropospheric ozone, can halve these losses by 2050 and save between US$4 to US$33 billion annually.Photo by Daniel Mensah Boafo on Unsplash.Impacts of short-lived climate pollutants on public health, ecosystems, and agricultural productivity have economic consequences.Reducing short-lived climate pollutants can have immediate economic benefits from job creation and increased household income – as well as lasting ancillary benefits from improved public health, reduced poverty and inequality, and lessened climate change impacts.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change will mean big changes for animals around the world. So if we care about incredible species, we must care about how a changing climate will make it harder for them to find food, and decrease their habitats – from forest to sea ice to the UK’s rivers and chalk streams.If you’re one of those people who need a coffee hit to get going, mornings may become grim. The effects of climate change on coffee are well-documented and coffee producers are already seeing reduced harvests, and more pests, because of it. Even if you’re caffeine-free you’re not in the clear – wine production may also be hit.Finding Nemo or Dory may become harder as their beautiful homes crumble under the stress of our changing climate. Warmer air and ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals lose their colour and may die. Ocean acidification – from increased CO2 in the atmosphere – compounds the problem. Today, the ocean is 26% more acidic than it was in 1990, and the Great Barrier Reef has just experienced unprecedented back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. Climate change is very bad news for anyone hoping to see the Great Barrier Reef one day.Did you know that 2 in every 3 people worldwide live in regions of severe water scarcity? Even a small increase in global temperatures will destabilise the water cycle and could make water scarcity much worse. Climate change affects rainfall patterns, meaning both drought and flooding will be more common, and more intense. And although it’s hardly comparable with life-threatening floods, climate change may already be making you late for work.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally temperature records  have been broken in recent years, and flooding in the UK gets worse. Year after year we’ve seen politicians wading through floods in Somerset, hopping into dinghies in Cornwall and arguing with each other in Westminster. More frequent and more intense extreme weather is a documented result of our greenhouse gas emissions, and the annual cost of flooding in the UK could increase 15-fold by the 2080s. We need to see politicians taking serious action on reducing the UK's carbon footprint, not looking for the next photo opportunity.Unique, irreplaceable, and often described as ‘the world’s lungs’, rainforests are some of the most precious habitats on the planet. They really are amazing; the Amazon, for example, is home to an astonishing 1 in 10 of all the known species on Earth. Yet over a third of the Amazon rainforest is already threatened by climate change. It’s a double-edged sword too: worldwide, forest destruction – mainly for agriculture – is a major cause of climate change, generating an incredible amount of greenhouse gases.With increasing carbon emissions, it stands to reason that we face compromised air quality. This affects human health, especially children. Air pollution can lead to asthma, heart and lung disease. Beijing’s insidious smog is a visible reminder of this, but bad air quality is also making headlines in the UK, and has been labelled a ‘public health emergency’ by MPs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not all bad news. Some of the biggest advancements in technology over the past few years have come from trying to limit, and come up with alternatives to, humanity’s CO2 dependency. Solar panels, wave-energy conversion and wind farms are allowing us to harness the power of nature in a clean way, harvesting energy without harming our environment or destroying habitats. Meanwhile nifty gadgets – like the Wall-E sized robot that can insulate your house to save energy – are helping to cut carbon in unexpected places. More of this technology could mean a cleaner, healthier future for us and our planet – because clean tech doesn’t just help nature, it also has the potential to build better, more accessible and people-friendly cities.limate change won’t just impact forest, or coral reefs, or even people in far-off countries – it will affect all of us. From more extreme weather to increasing food prices, to recreation and decreased opportunities to appreciate the natural world, people everywhere will feel its effects. Reducing our carbon footprint is fundamentally necessary to create a world where people and nature thrive – and that’s why WWF is working on it.We are fortunate to live in a beautiful, diverse, nurturing, awe-inspiring planet. Our children, and all future generations, deserve the same.If you’re feeling worried by now, you’re not alone. Millions of people are working together for our planet. Events like Earth Hour are a brilliant reminder that together, humanity is capable of great things, and we can make change happen for the right reasons.Already, so much has changed since we first heard about the possible effect of climate change. Beginning with the Rio Earth Summit, then the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, action on a global scale is speeding up. Now it is more important than ever that we use our action, our votes and our voices to tell political and business leaders that action on climate is absolutely essential.</p>
    <hr><br><h2 style="color: darkblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">8. Measures taken to tackle Global Warming:</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising sea levels. Raging storms. Searing heat. Ferocious fires. Severe drought. Punishing floods. The effects of climate change are already threatening our health, our communities, our economy, our security, and our children’s future.What can you do? A whole lot, as it turns out. Americans, on average, produce 21 tons of carbon a year, about four times the global average. Personal action is, of course, no substitute for meaningful government policies. We still must limit carbon pollution and aggressively move away from dirty fossil fuels toward cleaner power.But it’s important to remember the equally vital contributions that can be made by private citizens—which is to say, by you. “Change only happens when individuals take action,” says clean energy advocate Aliya Haq. “There’s no other way, if it doesn’t start with people.”Here are a dozen easy, effective ways each one of us can make a difference.Saving water reduces carbon pollution, too. That's because it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and treat your water. So take shorter showers, turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, and switch to WaterSense-labeled fixtures and appliances. The EPA estimates that if just one out of every 100 American homes were retrofitted with water-efficient fixtures, about 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year would be saved—avoiding 80,000 tons of global warming pollution.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s the single biggest way you can make an impact on global climate change? “Talk to your friends and family, and make sure your representatives are making good decisions,” Haq says. By voicing your concerns—via social media or, better yet, directly to your elected officials—you send a message that you care about the warming world. Encourage Congress to enact new laws that limit carbon emissions and require polluters to pay for the emissions they produce. “The main reason elected officials do anything difficult is because their constituents make them,” Haq says. You can help protect public lands, stop offshore drilling, and more here.Choose a utility company that generates at least half its power from wind or solar and has been certified by Green-e Energy, an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, take a look at your electric bill; many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on their monthly statements and websites.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Building heating and cooling are among the biggest uses of energy,” Haq says. Indeed, heating and air-conditioning account for almost half of home energy use. You can make your space more energy efficient by sealing drafts and ensuring it’s adequately insulated. You can also claim federal tax credits for many energy efficiency home improvements. To help you figure out where to start, you could also get a home energy audit, which some utilities offer free of charge. (Alternatively, you can hire a professional to come to your home and perform one; the Inflation Reduction Act offers a partial tax credit for this.) The EPA’s Home Energy Yardstick gives you a simple assessment of your home’s annual energy use compared with similar homes.Since they were first implemented nationally in 1987, efficiency standards for dozens of appliances and products have kept 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the air. That’s about the same amount as the annual carbon pollution coughed up by nearly 440 million cars. “Energy efficiency is the lowest-cost way to reduce emissions,” Haq says. When shopping for refrigerators, washing machines, heat pump water heaters, and other appliances, look for the Energy Star label. It will tell you which are the most efficient. (There may also be rebates to earn from your purchase of Energy Star–certified products.)</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://previews.agefotostock.com/previewimage/medibigoff/82e366823ced3e3566e7178814a25654/esy-027616887.jpg" alt="loading the image" height="300" width="600">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you’re ready to swap out your old machines, don’t just put them on the curb: Recycling an old refrigerator through the EPA’s Responsible Appliance Disposal Program can prevent an additional 10,000 pounds of carbon pollution because the global-warming pollutants in the refrigerants and foam would be properly captured rather than vented to the air.Approximately 10 percent of U.S. energy use goes into growing, processing, packaging, and shipping food—about 40 percent of which winds up in the landfill. “If you’re wasting less food, you’re likely cutting down on energy consumption,” Haq says. As for the scraps you can’t eat or the leftovers you don’t get to, collect them in a compost bin instead of sending them to the landfill where they release methane. Recycling food and other organic waste into compost provides a range of environmental benefits, including improving soil health, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, recycling nutrients, and mitigating the impact of droughts.Gas-smart cars, such as hybrids and fully electric vehicles, save fuel and money. And once all cars and light trucks meet 2025’s clean car standards, which means averaging 54.5 miles per gallon, they’ll be a mainstay. For good reason: Relative to a national fleet of vehicles that averaged only 28.3 miles per gallon in 2011, Americans will spend $80 billion less at the pump each year and cut their automotive emissions by half. Before you buy a new set of wheels, compare fuel-economy performance here.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LED light bulbs use one-sixth the amount of energy to deliver the same amount of light as conventional incandescents and last at least 10 times longer. They’re also cheaper in the long run: A 10-watt LED that replaces your traditional 60-watt bulb will save you $125 over the ligh bulb’s life. And because the average American home has around 40 to 50 light bulbs, this is a simple swap that will reap huge rewards. If every household in the United States replaced just one incandescent with an Energy Star–labeled LED, we would prevent seven billion pounds of carbon pollution per year. That’s equivalent to the emissions of about 648,000 cars.Taken together, the outlets in your home are likely powering about 65 devices—an average load for a home in the United States. Audio and video devices, cordless vacuums and power tools, and other electronics use energy even when they're not charging. This "idle load" across all U.S. households adds up to the output of 50 large power plants in the country. So don't leave fully charged devices plugged into your home's outlets, unplug rarely used devices or plug them into power strips and timers, and adjust your computers and monitors to automatically power down to the lowest power mode when not in use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing to live in walkable smart-growth cities and towns with quality public transportation leads to less driving, less money spent on fuel, and less pollution in the air. Less frequent flying can make a big difference, too. “Air transport is a major source of climate pollution,” Haq says. “If you can take a train instead, do that.” If you must fly, consider purchasing carbon offsets to counterbalance the hefty carbon pollution associated with flying. But not all carbon offset companies are alike. Do your homework to find the best supplier.</p>
    <hr><br><h2 style="color: darkblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">9. What happens if we fail to tackle Global Warming?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it, but that lag is less than a decade.While the effects of human activities on Earth's climate to date are irreversible on the timescale of humans alive today, every little bit of avoided future temperature increases results in less warming that would otherwise persist for essentially forever. The benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions occur on the same timescale as the political decisions that lead to those reductions.Without major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by 2.5 °C to 4.5 °C (4.5 °F to 8 °F) by 2100, according to the latest estimates.“Mitigation” – reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere“Adaptation” – learning to live with, and adapt to, the climate change that has already been set in motion. The key question is, what will our emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants be in the years to come?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If mankind fails to curtail global warming, we will have to deal with fallout ranging from massive refugee crises and submerged cities to scorching heatwaves and drought, scientists say.Starting Monday, 195 nations are huddled in Paris to negotiate a climate rescue pact to rein in the greenhouse gases that drive climate change.Ice blocks in the lake Cachet II in Aysen, Chilean Patagonia, 1700 Kms south of Santiago on April 6, 2012. The lake disappeared completely due to rising temperatures driven by climate change, according to experts.Without additional action, Earth is on track to heat up by about four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial levels.A mountain of scientific evidence tells us this would be a recipe for disaster.Such as "business as usual" emissions scenario would "lead to a very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible" impacts, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).By 2100, the world's oceans would rise 26-82 centimetres (10-32 inches) over levels seen between 1986-2005, the IPCC found in its most recent assessment, which includes data up to 2012. More recent studies suggest the increases could be significantly higher.Driving the rise are ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica shedding mass faster than ever, melting glaciers, and oceans that expand as they warm.Even a 2 C rise as targeted by the UN would submerge land currently occupied by 280 million people, according to Climate Central, a US-based research group. The change could take a few hundred years, or up to 2,000 years.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superstorms, bone-chilling cold snaps and intense heat waves could become more common — and more extreme — due to global warming.While the link between specific weather events and climate remains hard to nail down, recent research has teased out climate change as an aggravating factor for deadly floods, snowstorms, typhoons and heat waves.Not all nasty hurricanes or heat waves, however, can be chalked up to climate change, scientists caution.Global warming can lead to long-running droughts and devastating floods, which means some parts of the world will not have enough water and others too much.Droughts in Syria and California have been tied to climate change. Heavy rains carry the risk of flooding that can send people fleeing for their lives, destroy homes and crops.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is polluted, making you cough. You have to check the air quality before even opening a window. When you do go outside, your eyes water and you have to wear a mask — on bad days, a high tech mask, that is if you can afford it.Depending where you live, the temperature can be as hot as 140 degrees Fahrenheit for more than a month each year. In public restrooms, you have to pay to use water.And there’s a mental toll to living in a world that feels like a dangerous obstacle course. People feel bottomless despair and resent previous generations for their lack of action.“Air pollution and emissions that cause climate change go hand in hand, so less action on climate change will mean poorer air quality,” says Smith. “Whether it gets as bad as people having to wear masks by 2050 is debatable, [and] it should be possible to provide clean water without climate action.”So a 50% reduction by 2030, another 50% by 2040, another 50% by 2050,” Rivett-Carnac says.If that happens, the world in 2050 will be very different.“If we can decarbonize our economy rapidly ... down to near zero by mid-century, we can ... maintain a livable planet and a vibrant economy at the same time,” says Mann.In that future, write Figueres and Rivett-Carnac, city streets will have more trees and fewer cars and Americans can travel via high-speed electric railroads.</p>
    <hr><br><h2 style="color: darkblue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">10. Conclusion:</h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion,climate change is the most significant problem facing the world. Global warming is increasing day by day. If we cannot prevent it as soon as possible, our world will face undesirable consequences.The ‘Conclusion’ confirms that global warming is the major challenge for our global society. There is very little doubt that global warming will change our climate in the next century. So what are the solutions to global warming? First, there must be an international political solution. Second, funding for developing cheap and clean energy production must be increased, as all economic development is based on increasing energy usage. We must not pin all our hopes on global politics and clean energy technology, so we must prepare for the worst and adapt. If implemented now, a lot of the costs and damage that could be caused by changing climate can be mitigated.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming is not something to take lightly. The oceans are warming, the polar ice caps are melting, and greenhouse gas levels are at an all-time high. These are just some of the things that the claims-makers for the global warming cause have said. The science has proven them right. So, the ultimate claim is that humans are a large factor in the increased rate of global warming. There are claims-makers of all kinds fighting about whether that is true or not. The solutions proposed deal with a cleaner world, while the deniers will opt to do nothing.  This issue has turned political, and it seems like nothing gets done until someone who believes in global warming is in charge. Right now, that is not the case. This issue will continue to get worse until there is no turning back. Hopefully society can come to a consensus to try and inhibit global warming. This is the only way to keep the place we live healthy.</p>
